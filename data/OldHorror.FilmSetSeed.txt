# I think that the B-Movie Era can be said to have gone from 1948-1980:
#
# Beginning in 1948 with the Paramount Decrees.
#
# By 1961, the average production cost of an American feature film was still only $2 million—
# after adjusting for inflation, less than 10% more than it had been in 1950.
#
# It had taken a decade and a half, from 1961 to 1976, for the production cost of the average 
# Hollywood feature to double from $2 million to $4 million—a decline if adjusted for inflation. 
# In just four years it more than doubled again, hitting $8.5 million in 1980
